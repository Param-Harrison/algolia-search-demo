While we have worked with technical teams before, we are largely non-technical, so communication with non-technical people is a must. Initially, you will work collaboratively with the entire MovingWorlds team, and most closely with Derk Norde who leads our product strategy. To support your work and our product, MovingWorlds has a technical advisor to help with onboarding, code review, and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nOur platform was developed in Node.js on a PostgreSQL database by various developers over the last 4 years. Over the past year, we have mostly worked with external contractors. As we are growing our team and programs, we're now looking to onboard a full-stack JavaScript web developer to our core team. As you will be the first technical person on the current team, we will look to you for creative and smart solutions, and there will be a clear growth opportunity for you to build a technical team around you.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you will drive the following key success indicators of the company through constant process and technology improvements:\r\n\r\n● User experience scores of our platform, across all key stakeholders;\r\n● Number of successful Experteering projects matched and completed;\r\n● Reducing MovingWorlds program manager handling time per project match;\r\n● Leveraging cutting-edge technology (e.g. matching algorithms, AI) to drive our business forward;\r\n● Website uptime and performance.\r\n\r\nIf you feel this sounds like you, and you’re eager to join us to move worlds, apply now! Make sure your cover letter addresses the following:\r\n\r\n1) Why you’d like to join MovingWorlds;\r\n2) Why you're attracted by building this Experteering marketplace;\r\n3) What’s the biggest strength you can bring to our team;\r\n4) What you hope to learn;\r\n5) Link to your any online coding profile(s). Also, feel free to indicate or attach any code that you’re particularly proud of.\r\n\r\nFor the first 6 months, you'd be working from our Medellin office in Colombia. After 6 months, your location may be more flexible and you might be partly location independent.\r\n\r\nAs we grow and add new members to our core team, we are intentionally offering a modest starting salary with an attractive equity package, as we want to invest in the growth opportunity in front of us. We plan to raise salaries for the entire team based on revenue targets in 2018.\r\n",

Due to our unique environment in terms of having our own ecosystem of applications that support the business, working with us in a technical role is a great challenge. Any technical role at Mindvalley will provide a good mix of development work, systems thinking, problem-solving, and business analysis with a large dose of teamwork. \r\n\r\nWe generally look for attitude over aptitude when it comes to technical skills. A history of proven execution and excellent root cause analysis problem-solving skills are things that we value highly. We predominantly build apps with an nginx, Unicorn, Ruby, Redis and PostgreSQL architecture on Linode so experience with any of these will be valuable to us. \r\n\r\nWe run functional teams based on the SCRUM methodology and are a fairly Agile environment, with two-week sprints and teams with a minimum of 2 developers (preferably 3) plus a Platform Owner. Sprints can't be interrupted and work is planned out well in advance to keep stress down to a minimum. We have a focus on scalability, stability and code quality and we use tools such as Circle-CI and Code Climate to help with that. We ensure full test coverage for everything important and line-by-line code reviews for every pull request on Github—this maintains code quality and keeps everyone in the loop and learning.\r\n\r\nTo thrive in this role, you should be more than just a developer—someone who understands that a great app must do great things while being simple and intuitive. You are pixel-perfect, knowing that a pixel to the right is not merely a pixel to the right. You understand that organized code with well-applied design patterns will make a difference. You are fascinated with technology and eager to learn everything you can, applying the coolest and most amazing techniques there are. You always add your own magic touch that dazzles your users.\r\n\r\nBeing one of our talented developers, you'll have an opportunity to learn, grow, and be a key part of creating our products. Check out http://www.mindvalley.com/quests/ for our latest release. \r\n\r\nWe believe work needs to be fun, educational and something that makes so excited that you jump out of bed each morning. You'll be exposed to some of the best knowledge, people, and resources available anywhere, which you can apply to your own projects and become much more employable. \r\n\r\nWe're looking for people with a passion for technology, who want to have an impact and don't mind getting their hands dirty. If this is you, don't delay—jump on this opportunity now! When you apply, make sure to include links to software, mobile apps, your coding samples, or your web designs and portfolio so we can see proof of your talents.",

We are currently transitioning into a service-oriented architecture, powered by our own RESTful API. In parallel, we are scaling our infrastructure out into AWS in order to get maximum benefit out of the large variety of infrastructure-as-a-service approaches currently offered.\r\n\r\nAs a back-end engineer on our team, you will play an important role in further developing and rolling out our RESTful API, which will be at the base of all our current and future products. Your responsibilities range from working on the core of our systems all the way up to producing proof-of-concept web applications.\r\n\r\nNot only will you be extending our existing API, but you’ll also be building new API’s, micro-services and (micro-)applications following infrastructure-as-code principles. You, together with your scrum team, will take full ownership of these applications, all the way from their inception up to maintaining and monitoring their continued well-being.\r\n\r\nAs we are scaling our systems, and especially while we move towards full continuous delivery, new approaches to ensuring we deliver quality software are required. At StudyPortals we are greatly interested in applying the principles of test-driven development more structurally and we are thus looking for engineers with proven previous experience in this field. We hope you can help us in changing both our approach and our mindset to help us properly put test-driven development in practice.\r\n\r\nPlease note that a proven-track record in the field of test-driven development is a hard requirement for this position.
